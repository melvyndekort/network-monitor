# TODO - Network Monitor

## What's Done ✅

- **Terraform**: DynamoDB tables, SNS/SQS (with DLQs, subscriptions, queue policies), Lambda functions, IAM roles, provider/backend config
- **Terraform: API Gateway** (deployed 2026-03-15)
  - HTTP API v2 at `https://ys7ivwcdqf.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com`
  - IAM auth (SigV4) on all routes — unsigned requests get 403
  - Routes: `GET /devices`, `GET /devices/{mac}`, `PUT /devices/{mac}`, `DELETE /devices/{mac}`, `GET /devices/{mac}/history`, `GET /stats`, `GET /stats/vlan/{vlan_id}`
  - Lambda proxy integration with payload format 2.0
  - Tested: unsigned → 403, signed → 200 with `{"devices": []}`
- **Lambda code**: All 5 handlers implemented with unit tests (event-router, track-presence, send-notifications, enrich-metadata, api-handler)
- **CI/CD**: Reusable deploy-lambda workflow, per-Lambda trigger workflows, Terraform plan/apply workflow
- **IAM fix** (deployed 2026-03-15): event-router was missing DynamoDB permissions for `devices` and `deduplication` tables (only had `device_events`). Fixed and verified with end-to-end test.
- **End-to-end pipeline test** (2026-03-15): Sent manual `device_discovered` event to SQS → all 5 Lambdas fired successfully. Event-router stored event + created device, track-presence set state to online, enrich-metadata looked up manufacturer, send-notifications attempted Apprise (see known issue below).

## What's Left

### ~~Terraform: FIFO Queue DLQ~~
~~The `device_events` FIFO queue has a DLQ defined (`device_events_dlq`) but no `redrive_policy` attached to the main queue. The fan-out queues (presence-tracker, notifier, metadata-enricher) all have redrive policies — this one was missed.~~ ✅ Fixed

### ~~Apprise URL~~
~~The `send-notifications` Lambda has `APPRISE_URL` set to `apprise.internal.mdekort.nl`, which is not resolvable from AWS Lambda. Needs to be changed to the public Cloudflare Tunnel URL (`apprise.mdekort.nl` or similar).~~ ✅ Fixed — changed to `https://apprise.mdekort.nl`

### ~~Terraform: S3 Bucket for UI~~ ✅ Done
S3 bucket with static website hosting and public read policy.

### ~~Data Collector~~ ✅ Done
Implemented as `data_collector` Python package with uv/hatchling. 24 tests, 86% coverage.

### ~~Vector Config Changes (on compute-1)~~ ✅ Done
Deployed new `vector.toml` with docker_logs source, DHCP transform, SQS sink, dedupe. IAM user + SOPS-encrypted credentials.

### ~~Retire router-events~~ ✅ Done
Removed container, dropped MariaDB database and user.

### ~~UI~~ ✅ Done
Bootstrap 5 dark theme dashboard at `http://network-monitor-ui-844347863910.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com`. GET routes made public, PUT/DELETE remain IAM-protected. CORS enabled.

### ~~Documentation~~ ✅ Done
- `docs/api.md` — API reference with all endpoints
- `docs/event-types.md` — Event schema, types, state machine, routing
- `docs/grafana-setup.md` — Grafana Cloud setup with Infinity plugin

### ~~Scripts~~ ✅ Done
`scripts/deploy_ui.sh` for S3 sync. Lambda deployment handled by CI/CD.

### Grafana Dashboards
`examples/grafana-dashboards/` is empty. Need dashboard JSON for:
- Network overview
- Device details
- VLAN activity

### Shared Lambda Libraries
README mentions `lambdas/shared/` with `dynamodb.py`, `sns.py`, `models.py`. Currently each Lambda has inline boto3 code. Optional refactor.

### Tests
`tests/unit/` and `tests/integration/` are empty. Unit tests exist co-located in each Lambda dir. Central test dirs are unused.
